                             <p>
                               Our urban communities have become inaccessible and exclusionary. Combined with many other factors, the high cost of property has made home-ownership an unattainable dream for most residents. Only 37% of Millennials own their own home in the United States, <a href=""> down from 45% for Baby Boomers when they were the same age </a>. In Alameda County, the median home value was $875,000 in 2018, requiring a minimum annual income of $181,130 to qualify for a mortgage2. As a result, more people are forced to rent housing from profit seeking landlords, driving up rental costs. The average rent for a one bedroom apartment in the City of Berkeley increased by 9.5% annually between 2011 and 2019, from $1,371 to $2,408 per month3. For Oakland the same unit increased from $1,264 to $2,567, representing a 12.9% annual increase4. Rising costs of living are not limited to the Bay Area. Across the United States inflation-adjusted rent increased by 12% between 2000 and 2010, while household incomes fell by 7%, causing half of all renters in the country to spend more than 30% of income on rent5.

                                 Aaron believes in the power of technology and information to unify people and change the world. His passion for housing began in Cape Town, South Africa, where he developed data solutions for a microfinance organization which helped local residents of townships protect and improve their homes. Since then he has worked to support a variety of non-profit organizations and local governments on issues of affordable housing, historic preservation, and migrant rights. Aaron has also served as a researcher in the US House of Representatives, the Centre for European Economic Research, and LandLink Analytic Services--a company he founded during his undergraduate studies at Mercer University. After graduation from UC Berkeley, Aaron plans to begin a career as a Foreign Service Officer with USAID.

He’s an advocate for mobilizing communities and restorative justice practices and Ramsay believes that breaking cycles of violence which define our cities requires collaboration across sectors. Ramsay’s interest in conflict resolution began in his home of Burkina Faso whose current geopolitical situation has largely been influenced by a regional history of conflict and colonialism. Ramsay’s diverse experiences include working for the Neighborhood Associates Corporation in Washington DC, a (year) practicing Qi Gong meditation in Taiwan, and helping to co-found a startup which utilized blockchain technology to ensure traceability of minerals in ethical supply chains. Since starting his graduate education at UC Berkeley, Ramsay has become an active leader in the Berkeley Student Cooperative, where he is currently living in the Afro House. Ramsay loves playing and coaching soccer which he calls the ‘universal language’ that he’s used to connect with people across the globe.
