His passion for housing began in Cape Town, South Africa, where he developed data solutions for a microfinance organization which helped local residents of townships protect and improve their homes. Since then he has worked to support a variety of non-profit organizations and local governments on issues of affordable housing, historic preservation, and migrant rights. Aaron has also served as a researcher in the US House of Representatives, the Centre for European Economic Research, and LandLink Analytic Services--a company he founded during his undergraduate studies at Mercer University. After graduation from UC Berkeley, Aaron plans to begin a career as a Foreign Service Officer with USAID. When he isn’t teaching data science at Cal or drafting a new financial analysis model, Aaron enjoys reading sci-fi paperbacks with a triple shot of espresso.",

He’s an advocate for mobilizing communities and restorative justice practices and Ramsay believes that breaking cycles of violence which define our cities requires collaboration across sectors. Ramsay’s interest in conflict resolution began in his home of Burkina Faso whose current geopolitical situation has largely been influenced by a regional history of conflict and colonialism. Ramsay’s diverse experiences include working for the Neighborhood Associates Corporation in Washington DC, seven months practicing Qi Gong meditation in Taiwan, and helping to co-found a startup which utilized blockchain technology to ensure traceability of minerals in ethical supply chains. Since starting his graduate education at UC Berkeley, Ramsay has become an active leader in the Berkeley Student Cooperative, where he is currently living in the Afro House. Ramsay loves playing and coaching soccer which he calls the ‘universal language’ that he’s used to connect with people across the globe.",
